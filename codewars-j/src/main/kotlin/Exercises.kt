    Write a function that accepts fight string

    who wins the fight. When the left side wins
    return Left side wins!, when the right side
    wins return Right side wins!, in other case
    return Let's fight again!.

    The left side letters and their power:
     w - 4
     p - 3

     s - 1

    The right side letters and their power:

    AlphabetWar("zdqmwpbs"); //=> Let's fight again!
    AlphabetWar("zzzzs");    //=> Right side wins!
